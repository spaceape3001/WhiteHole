# World Writing Wrangler

World Writing Wrangler (WW Wrangler) is about world building for stories, universes, D&D campaigns, or even trying to keep track of who's who in Game of Thrones.   WW Wrangler will be a collection of tools to assist the author/creator in developing their world.

**Data resides with the USER** is an important mantra in this development.
