# Your Quill's Toolbox

This is the general utility toolbox for my Your Quill project.  It's split into a separate repository so it can be used with other projects as it contains a nice meta system, math, and other miscellaneous utilities.

## Additional Information

### Building

Your Quill uses CMake for build management and C++20 as the language standard.  On linux, the build type is determined based on the final directory name (ie build/Debug vs build/Release).
